**Project description:** Mapped trees at UMBC by diameter and Tree Type. Mapped out floodplain and used ARC GIS to show tree size, type and location

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena
Trees are larger inside the the floodplain to to an increase in nuterients from additonal water. Most tree species either want to be in the floodplain or want to be on the outside, only american Beech was found in both areas.
